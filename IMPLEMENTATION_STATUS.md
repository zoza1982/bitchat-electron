## Implementation Log

### December 3, 2025
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with comprehensive 18-week roadmap
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for tracking progress
- Completed Week 1 project initialization (5/6 tasks):
  - ✅ Created package.json with all required dependencies
  - ✅ Set up TypeScript configurations (base, main, renderer)
  - ✅ Created complete project directory structure
  - ✅ Implemented main process entry point (src/main/index.ts)
  - ✅ Created preload script for secure IPC (src/preload/preload.ts)
    - Following Electron security best practices with contextBridge
    - No direct exposure of ipcRenderer methods
    - Filtered callbacks to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
  - ✅ Built React renderer app with basic UI components
  - ✅ Set up webpack configurations for main, renderer, and preload

### December 3, 2025 - Continued
- Completed Week 2: Binary Protocol Implementation
  - ✅ Created BinaryProtocol class with encode/decode methods
  - ✅ Implemented BitchatProtocol for high-level operations
  - ✅ Added message fragmentation support for BLE MTU (512 bytes)
  - ✅ Implemented message encoding/decoding with optional fields
  - ✅ Added padding for traffic analysis resistance
  - ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
  - ✅ Created protocol test vectors for compatibility verification
  - ✅ Updated package.json with Jest types
  - ✅ Configured Jest for TypeScript testing
